    description: "The Kia EV6 is the brand's first dedicated electric vehicle built on the Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) shared with the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and Genesis GV60. Featuring a distinctive 'Opposites United' design philosophy, it combines crossover-like ground clearance with a sleek, coupe-inspired roofline and dramatic surface treatments. The exterior incorporates aerodynamic elements including a low nose, active air flaps, and a rear spoiler, contributing to a drag coefficient of just 0.28. The unique lighting signature includes a sequential LED pattern at the front and a full-width light bar at the rear. Available with either a 58 kWh or 77.4 kWh battery pack, and in single-motor rear-wheel drive or dual-motor all-wheel drive configurations, power outputs range from 167 HP to 576 HP in the performance-oriented GT model. Range varies by configuration, with up to 310 miles possible in the most efficient variants. One of the EV6's most distinctive features is its 800V electrical architecture that enables ultra-fast DC charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in as little as 18 minutes at compatible charging stations. The interior features a minimalist approach with a curved display combining a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen under a single piece of glass, augmented reality head-up display, and sustainable materials including fabrics made from recycled plastics. Advanced technology includes Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) functionality allowing the car to power external devices or even charge other EVs, remote smart parking assist, and Highway Driving Assist 2 with lane change capabilities. As Kia's flagship electric vehicle, the EV6 represents the company's shift toward electrification while establishing a new design language for its upcoming EVs, combining striking aesthetics with practical innovation and performance. The model has received critical acclaim, winning the 2022 European Car of the Year award and establishing Kia as a serious player in the premium electric vehicle market."
